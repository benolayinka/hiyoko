# Three-bootstrap-react template

I'm constantly using the same boilerplate to create web apps with

- React
- Bootstrap
- Three.js

So I made a boilerplate repo to start easily.

It uses the following bit.dev packages
- benolayinka.benolayinka.three-scene-renderer
- benolayinka.benolayinka.basic-scene-builder
- benolayinka.benolayinka.utils

## Running the app locally

`npm install` to install necessary packages
`npm start` to run the app in development mode with hot reloading

## Building the app

`npm run build` will build production assets to /build

## Troubleshooting

### `npm start fails: sh: react-scripts: command not found`

Packages aren't installed. Run:

`npm install`
